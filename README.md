## Data Analysis Project with R

This project aims to conduct a data analysis using the R software. Below, the three main exercises addressed in this work are described.

### Exercise 1

#### 1.1 Presentation of the Dataset

In this section, the dataset used in the exercise is introduced. Details such as the dataset name and the meaning of each column are provided. Additionally a prior analysis of the data is carried out to obtain significant information about the distribution and relationships between the variables.

#### 1.2 Study with K-means Method

A study is conducted using the K-means method. The steps taken are described, and the results obtained are presented. Relevant visualizations and metrics are presented to support the classification.

### Exercise 2

#### 2.1 Study with DBSCAN and OPTICS

In this section, a study is conducted using the DBSCAN and OPTICS methods. The parameters used are described, and the results obtained are presented. Relevant visualizations and metrics are presented to support the classification.

### Exercise 3

#### 3.1 Comparison between K-means and DBSCAN

In this exercise, a comparison is made between the K-means and DBSCAN methods. The strengths and weaknesses of each method are analyzed, highlighting situations where one may be more suitable than the other. Relevant metrics are presented to support the comparison.
